# Create Node App
Create a JavaScript or TypeScript Node application with ease.

## Quick Overview
```sh
mkdir my-app-dir
cd my-app-dir
npx @kwalox/create-node-app my-app
```


## Creating an app
This was build for Node 16.0.0 or later version. I can't garantee that older version will work without configuration.

To create a new app, follow the steps below:

### npx
This command will create files in your current directory.
```sh
npx @kwalox/create-node-app my-app
```
It will generate the initial project structure without installing dependencies. Add `--install` if you want dependencies to be immediately installed.
